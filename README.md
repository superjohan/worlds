# worlds

a demo for iphone by dekadence.

programming and music by ricky martin.
words by karl marx and friedrich engels.

note: this project will also live on https://github.com/superjohan/worlds

open the project in xcode, and install on your iphone. tested on iphone x and 7, on which the demo works fine.

i'll try to get the demo on the app store, but i doubt apple will ever allow this on the store. (they're not too keen on demos)

a port for tvos (i.e. appletv) could come at some point, and possibly a mac version.

greets to jumalauta and all other cool folks.
