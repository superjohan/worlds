programming and music by johan halin (aka ricky martin / dekadence).
words by karl marx and friedrich engels.

open the project in xcode, and install on your iphone. tested on iphone x and 7, on which the demo works fine.

i'll try to get the demo on the app store, but i doubt apple will ever allow this on the store. (they're not too keen on demos) [update 27.11.2017: got rejected for "minimal functionality"]

[update 13.12.2017: after a phone call with an apple representative and a complaint to the app review appeals board, it's by now clear that this demo will never be on the app store in its current form. i have some ideas on how to package the demo so that it'd be allowed, but for now this is the only way of distributing the demo to potential viewers. needless to say i don't agree with apple's reasoning at all and consider their policies anti-art.]

[update 5.2.2018: [the demo is now available on the app store as part of the jumalauta collection!](https://itunes.apple.com/fi/app/the-jumalauta-collection/id1344164506?mt=8)]

greets to jumalauta and all other cool folks.
